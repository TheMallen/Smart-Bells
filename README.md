A note on code from Ruby on Rails Tutorial
------------------------------------------
In some places my code is very similar, and in others I took issue with the architecture they used (after reading the Ruby on Rails guides a bit). In places where I mostly agreed the code is quite similar. As such I have commented them heavily to show understanding, as well as written in the section header "based on [reference]" in cases where modified but still similar, and "from [reference]" in cases where third party code was kept (done minimally)

It should be noted that
- even the rails guide code looks almost the same in their example for logins in some places (although they put session handling right in the ApplicationController)
- login is probably the most generic part of the app and as such it is bound to be similar

**Please let me know if I need to modify this type of code more thoroughly for the larger submissions**
